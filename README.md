# NvidiaAIDenoiser-Batch

Just an extension I made for DeclanRussell's [NvidiaAIDenoiser](https://github.com/DeclanRussell/NvidiaAIDenoiser) program, with batch denoising support. Also my first small project in years with Python.

This is not a drop-in replacement or anything of some sort, it's just a simple Python code designed to be more user-friendly.

## Requirements

Of course, make sure you have Python 3 installed before running this! (Unless you are using the executable)

And make sure you have NvidiaAIDenoiser added to PATH before using the script.
The script will guide you through the things you'll have to specify.

## Why did I make this?

I've been trying to find an intuitive image denoiser program to remove the JPEG compression of a JPEG image/processed video, but I only found ones that were way beyond my understanding to use or just too difficult to use. I could only do so much as use something like this, but even this isn't really the main focus of what I'm finding as I realized it doesn't work with JPEG deblocking. Oh well.
