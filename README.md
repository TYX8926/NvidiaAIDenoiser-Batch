# NvidiaAIDenoiser-Batch

Just an extension I made for DeclanRussell's NvidiaAIDenoiser program, this time with batch denoising support. Also my first small project in years with Python.

This is not a drop-in replacement or anything of some sort, it's just a simple Python code designed to be more user-friendly.

## Usage

Of course, make sure you have Python 3 installed before running this!

And make sure you have NvidiaAIDenoiser added to PATH before using the script.
The script will guide you through the things you'll have to specify.

## Why did I make this?

I've been trying to find an intuitive image denoiser program to remove the JPEG compression of a JPEG image/processed video, but I only found ones that were way beyond my understanding to use or just too difficult to use. I could only do so much as use something like this. Oh well.
