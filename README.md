# NvidiaAIDenoiser-Batch

Just an extension I made for DeclanRussell's NvidiaAIDenoiser program, this time with batch denoising support. Also my first small project in years with Python.

This is not a drop-in replacement or anything of some sort, it's just a simple Python code designed to be more user-friendly.
